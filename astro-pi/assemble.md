# Assemble the Astro Pi

1. If you have not yet installed the Astro Pi HAT now is the time for them to do so. Do this with the Raspberry Pi shut down (disconnected from the mains) and with all other cables disconnected.
1. The Astro Pi HAT comes in a silver anti static bag along with the following fixtures and fittings:
  - 1 x GPIO pin extension header
  - 4 x Hexagon Stand Offs (female to female)
  - 8 x M2.5 screws

  Check that these are all present before proceeding.
1. This diagram shows how it all fits together.

1. Put the GPIO extension header block onto the Raspberry Pi GPIO pins first.
1. Then screw the hexagon stand-offs to the Raspberry Pi itself by threading the screws through from the bottom and turning the hexagon stand-offs between finger and thumb.
1. Next insert the Astro Pi sense HAT onto the GPIO pin extension header. The corner holes should line up with the hexagon stand-offs.
1. Lastly put the remaining screws through from the top.
1. Use a small Phillips screwdriver to tighten each corner stand-off individually. It doesn't need to be especially tight, just enough to ensure it doesn't become loose.
