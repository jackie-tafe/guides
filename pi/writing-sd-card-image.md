# How to get and install NOOBS

To get started with Raspberry Pi you need an operating system. NOOBS (New Out Of the Box Software) is an easy operating system install manager for the Raspberry Pi.

## Buy a preinstalled SD Card

The easiest way to get NOOBS is to buy an SD card with NOOBS already installed, available at the [Swag Store](http://swag.raspberrypi.org/products/noobs-8gb-sd-card). Alternatively, if you have an SD card (8GB recommended), then you can download NOOBS for free and install it on your card.

## Download

1. Using a computer with an SD card reader, visit the offical Raspberry Pi [Downloads page](http://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/).
1. Click on the Download ZIP button under ‘NOOBS (offline and network install)’, and select a folder to save it to.
1. Extract the files from the zip.

## Format your SD Card

It is best to format your SD card before copying the NOOBS files onto it. To do this:

1. Visit the [SD Association’s website](http://www.sdcard.org/) and download [SD Formatter 4.0](https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter_4/index.html) for either Windows or Mac.
1. Follow the instructions to install the software.
1. Insert your SD card into the computer or laptop’s SD card reader and make a note of the drive letter allocated to it, e.g. `G:/`
1. In SD Formatter, select the drive letter for your SD card and format it.

## Drag and drop NOOBS files

1. Once your SD card has been formatted, drag all the files in the extracted NOOBS folder and drop them onto the SD card drive.
1. The necessary files will then be transferred to your SD card.
1. When this process has finished, safely remove the SD card and insert it into your Raspberry Pi.
