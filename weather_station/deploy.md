Raspberry Pi Weather Station Trials
Assembly Instructions
Dear participant,
Welcome to the Raspberry Pi weather station trial. The purpose of the trial is twofold. Firstly to test
that the equipment performs as expected when exposed to the British weather and secondly to seed
further development of the weather station scheme of work.
You are not obliged to contribute in this way but any feedback and input from you, as a tester, will
be greatly appreciated.
Please take some time to read through these instructions before assembling the weather station kit.
Please report any problems to dave@raspberrypi.org
Thanks again for your support!
Kind regards
David Honess

a. 1 x AIR circuit board (held in by a screw)
b. 1 x Packet of 4 screws
 1 x Large plastic junction box
a. 1 x Large circuit board (held in by two screws)
b. 1 x Coiled black wire (attached to the board)
c. 1 x Silica gel sachet (with the word KEEP on it)
d. 1 x Packet of 4 screws
 1 x Plumb SURE rubber washers (pack of 4)

 1 x Switching Battery Elimination Circuit
 1 x 24 volt AC/DC Power Adapter with UK Plug
 1 x Raspberry Pi model B+
 1 x Micro SD card with Full SD adapter
If anything is missing from your kit then it's probably our fault so please get in touch as soon as
possible and we will send you a replacement.
Step 2: Acquire other necessary items
You will also need the following items that you must obtain yourself:
 A length of CAT5 or CAT6 Ethernet Cable
This cable will supply both power and network connectivity to the weather station. While
working on the kitchen table you can use any short length of Ethernet cable you like but
when you deploy outside the cable will need to reach from your school building / house to
the location that you choose for the Weather Station outside.
Side Note: It may be easier for you to get a reel of Ethernet cable, cut it to the length that you require, and crimp the plugs on
with a crimp tool. Your IT guys will probably have this kind of thing in a cupboard somewhere and should have the skills to do
this for you (if necessary). The cable used should be outdoor rated. This just means that the plastic used to make the sheath
does not degrade over time when in contact with sunlight. The plastic used in common Ethernet cables will become brittle /
flaky over time.
 A roll of Gaffa tape
This will be used to help create a better seals for some of the cables coming out of the
weather station case. It must be Gaffa tape, do not use any other kind of tape.
 A scalpel or craft knife
Used to cut the holes in the weather station case where cables will go in and out. Do not
allow children or students to use this unsupervised.
 A pair of pliers
These will be used to tighten up the cable grommets / glands to make a tight seal for the
cables. Student supervision is also recommended.
 An Ethernet switch or hub (with Internet access)
To provide internet connectivity to the weather station.
It is highly recommended that you get the Weather Station up and running in a controlled
environment (such as your classroom or kitchen table) before you attempt to deploy it outside.
This way you have the opportunity to resolve any problems that you may encounter.
When you go to deploy it outside you will also need various DIY tools such as a power drill, screw
drivers and suchlike. This side of the deployment is very much left up to you since no one solution
will be right for everyone. Coming up with a solution for this can be a very fun and interesting
activity for students. The weather station scheme of work will contain guidance on choosing an
appropriate site for deployment though.
Step 3: Create some AIR holes
Take the smaller junction box (with the AIR board inside) and use the scalpel or craft knife to cut out
the bottom three holes in the base of the case. These are the holes on the opposite side to where
the AIR board is screwed in. Cut the rubber slowly and be careful not to injure yourself. These holes
allow the air to go inside this case to be sampled by the air sensors on the circuit board.
You'll notice that the AIR board has a shiny coating. This is SSC3 conformal coating and it's designed
to protect the board and solder joints from atmospheric corrosion (since it's going to be exposed to
the air). With this coating it should also survive in coastal air conditions.
Take the short black RJ11 cable, pass one side through the middle hole, and insert the plug into the
AIR board. This is how the AIR board will connect to the main part of the weather station.
Put this to one side for now.
Step 4: Make holes for the Cable grommets
This, above, is one of the cable grommets. They are used to make a water proof seal for a cable
going into the main weather station case. There are three parts: a domed nut on the left, a double
screw in the middle and a washer on the right.
The double screw in the middle has an iris which is closed in to form a water tight seal around the
cable by tightening the domed nut. The washer goes inside the case and is used to squeeze the
rubber aperture of the case to form another water tight seal.
Take the base of the large junction box and line up one of the cable glands with the concentric rings
as shown above. This should give you a good idea where you need to cut to make a hole for the
screw of the cable grommet. The hole needs to be a tight fit.
Use the scalpel or craft knife to make the cut at 45
degrees as if you were aiming downwards towards
the middle of the rings. This helps to make a nice
seal between the rubber and the cable grommet
screw.
Repeat this process for the five holes shown in the
picture below. The three below the main weather
board and the two on the left. Each hole should be
the same size since they will each take the same
kind of cable grommet.
Step 5: Install the ground temperature probe grommet
The black coil of wire inside the large junction box is the ground temperature probe. Uncoil it
completely and straighten out any twists in the cable. Take a cable grommet and unscrew the
bottom washer. Pass the washer over the top of the end of the probe as shown below.
Run the washer all the way down to the base of the cable where it attaches to the main board. The
three small holes around the edge should be facing upwards as shown below.
Next pass the end of the probe through the middle hole in the case, from the inside to the outside,
as shown below.
Pull the rest of the cable all the way through the hole in the case. Now pass the end of the probe
through cable grommet, so it emerges from the domed nut, as shown below.
Slide the grommet all the way down to the case and push the screw into the hole, it should need a
bit of force. See below.
IMPORTANT: This cable is slightly too narrow for the grommet iris to close tightly around. So we
need to make the cable a little wider by wrapping some Gaffa tape around it. The iris can then make
a tight seal onto the Gaffa tape.
Firstly use pen or a fingernail to mark the place where the cable comes out of the grommet. Then
slide it back along the cable and start winding the Gaffa tape around where your mark was as shown
above.
Try to keep the winding tight and avoid messy
folds in the tape. This can be a bit of a tricky job
and helps a lot if you can get another person to
assist. One person holds the wire steady while the
other winds the tape. Keep going until the cable
has become around 1.5 cm thick as shown right.
Now slide the grommet back down the cable and
into position and screw the washer into place on
the inside.
Hand tighten both the domed nut and the washer for now but remember to tighten thoroughly
using a pair of pliers before taking it outside for deployment.
The intention is for you to bury the tip of the temperature probe in the ground, at a depth of 4
inches, when you deploy the weather station outside.
Step 6: Install the Wind Vane grommet
The wind vane has a long length of cable connected to it, on the end is an RJ11 plug. Pass this
through the domed end of one of the cable grommet, without the washer, as shown above and slide
it down the cable to keep it out of the way.
The weather station board has an RJ11 socket marked WIND. Place the grommet washer over the
connector as shown above and pass the wind vane cable through the corresponding hole in the case,
then through the washer and into the RJ11 socket. This can be a little bit fiddly. You can then screw
the washer onto the grommet screw.
This cable is also too narrow for the grommet to
close tightly around. So we need to wrap it in
some Gaffa tape as we did for the ground
temperature probe.
Use a pen or fingernail to mark where the cable
comes out of the grommet and wrap the Gaffa
tape around this point. You can then reinsert the
grommet into the case and hand tighter the
washer and dome nut.
Remember to tighten thoroughly using a pair of pliers before taking it outside for deployment.
Note: The anemometer (wind speed sensor) plugs into a socket on the bottom of the wind vane.
Step 7: Install the Rain Gauge grommet
The instructions here are essentially identical to the previous step. The image below shows how it
should look when you're finished.
Step 8: Install the Power over Ethernet grommet
The Ethernet cable is used to both supply power and a network connection for Internet access. If
you are using a cable with a machined plug (as shown above) you will need to modify it slightly
before it will fit through a cable grommet.
Take the scalpel or craft knife and cut the plastic clip over off completely, see right.
Take care to not damage the plastic clip itself (this
is used to lock the Ethernet cable into its socket).
You may also need to slightly shave the back of the
plug where two square ridges stick out.
Firstly pass the dome nut of the grommet over the
plug as shown right, this should indicate if you still
need to use the scalpel to slightly shave the back of
the machined plug. It might need a bit of force to
get it through after you've done this. If you're
using hand crimped plugs it should go straight
through easily.
Next pass the double screw part of the grommet over the Ethernet plug as shown above, the iris part
will stretch a little when you do this but this will not damage it. You can now screw the dome nut
onto the grommet screw and slide it down the cable to keep it out of the way.
The Ethernet cable should enter the case using the hole between the ground temperature probe and
the wind vane, as shown above. Pass it through the hole of the case and then through a grommet
washer. You can then insert the grommet into the case and screw the washer onto it.
This cable is thick enough to not need Gaffa tape in order to make a tight seal.
Next open the POE set packet and take out the one with the male barrel jack, the splitter, as shown
above. Connect the large block end to the Ethernet cable and slide them both into the position
shown. No Ethernet cable should be inside the case, the plug should come in and go straight into
the POE splitter as shown.
Step 9: Install the AIR sensor grommet
The AIR sensor board, in the smaller case, is
connected to the main board by way of a short
RJ11 cable. This cable is handmade, crimped, so
be sure to treat it carefully. It's made from
outdoor rated Ethernet cable but with two of the
wires not used (the brown pair).
Disconnect the cable from the AIR board
completely for this part. Slide one of the plastic
sheath, shown right, back down the cable on one
end. This will not fit through a grommet so you
can cut it off with the scalpel if you want to.
Push the cable through the dome nut and grommet as shown above. Then thread the RJ11 plug
through the hole to the right of the ground temperature probe, then through a grommet washer and
finally into the RJ11 socket marked AIR (see below).
Hand tighten the grommet washer and dome nut. That's all of the cable grommets installed.
Reconnect the AIR board and this is roughly how your weather station should look.
Step 10: Install the SBEC
SBEC stands for Switching Battery Elimination
Circuit and we're using one here to step the voltage
down from 24 volts coming in via Power over
Ethernet to 5 volts DC that the Raspberry Pi can
consume. A 26 V one is shown right but some of
you will have 40 V ones.
Power over Ethernet always involves a degree of
voltage line loss. So, depending on the length of
your Ethernet cable that runs outside to the
weather station, anything between the full 24 volts and 6 could be arriving at the other end. This is
why we put more than the normal 5 volts into the cable: to compensate for line loss. The SBEC will
then take whatever voltage arrives and step it down to 5 volts DC for the Pi.
One end of the SBEC will have a female barrel jack, connect this to the male barrel jack of the Power
over Ethernet splitter shown above.
The other end of the SBEC has a three way pin header. This will provide power and ground to the
weather board and Raspberry Pi. It should connect to the three pins that are sticking up on the top
edge of the weather board, the words UBEC are printed next to the connector.
IMPORTANT: Ensure that the red wire goes in on the right, closest to the POWER label, as shown in
the picture below.
The SBEC can then sit in the empty space above the weather board, you may wish to use a hot glue
gun, or similar, to stick it into place.
Step 11: Install the Raspberry Pi and boot up
Note: You'll need a console to use with the
Raspberry Pi for this (screen, keyboard and mouse
etc).
The next stage is to install the Raspberry Pi and
start setting up the software for the weather
station. You have probably been given a NOOBS SD
card so it may be worthwhile for you to set up the
Raspberry Pi in isolation, separate from the
weather station, in order to complete the NOOBS
installation.
Please use Raspbian. Do any extra configuration of the Pi that you require now. Shut down your Pi
and disconnect it from everything after you're done.
The Raspberry Pi is inserted, upside down, into the weather board as shown above right. Ensure
that the pin header lines up with the GPIO pins correctly, no pins should stick out on either side.
Ensure the Raspberry Pi is fully inserted into the pin header on the weather board.
Note: We have not provided stand offs to screw the weather board down, however the mounting
holes are there if you wish to use them. Their use is not strictly necessary though.
Once the Raspberry Pi in position connect the Ethernet plug of the POE splitter to the Raspberry Pi
Ethernet port as shown below.
Then connect the keyboard, mouse and screen to the Raspberry Pi as shown below.
Some of you may find the AIR socket is in the way of the Raspberry Pi HDMI port, you should be able
to manage by tilting the Raspberry Pi upwards. It should not be a problem to bend it slightly like this
so that the HDMI lead can go in.
Next we need to connect the power. Take the 24 volt UK power supply and connect its barrel jack to
the female jack on the Power over Ethernet injector as shown below.
Next plug the Ethernet plug of the POE injector into a network switch or hub that can provide
Internet access.
Connect the other end of the Ethernet cable, leading to the weather station, to the POE injector.
Then just plug the UK power supply into a wall socket and turn it on. You should immediately see a
blue light on the SBEC and the normal Raspberry Pi boot up sequence should display on your screen.
Log in as per usual, test your internet access, and you're ready for the next step.
Step 12: Install the software and test it
This next step is going to take some time. So get a cup of tea and settle in. The task now is to
configure the Raspberry Pi to behave like a data logging weather station. In order to do that several
configuration files of Raspbian need to be changed and a some software needs to be installed.
The instructions for deploying the data logging code are found online here:
https://github.com/raspberrypi/weather-station
Follow the instructions carefully, take your time and read everything. Do not skip the text.
There is also a demo website template which can be used to display the data collected by your
weather station, the instructions for this can be found online here:
https://github.com/raspberrypi/weather-station-www
At this point you have the choice to either go into full data logging mode or, alternatively, leave the
data logging mode off and have a look at working through our Weather Station Scheme of Work
which can be found online here:
https://github.com/raspberrypilearning/weather-station-sow
If you see this 404 message on the right then
you'll need to create a Github account and
email the username to me. I will then invite
you into the closed group who can see the
content.
Step 13: Deployment outside
When you come to deploy the weather station the first thing to do is ensure that all the cable
grommet nuts and washers are securely tightened (all except the power over Ethernet one). The
POE grommet will be the last thing you tighten after installation before screwing the lid down. Use a
pair of pliers for this.
Next you'll need to select a location for the weather station outside. Advice on a choice of site will
be given by the deployment lesson in the scheme of work. Generally speaking though a place away
from buildings and out in the open is good. The aim of the trial is to test the sensors and equipment
against the elements, so you can get away with an unscientific location choice here if it's easier for
you (as long as it's outside).
Ensure you have a long enough Ethernet cable to reach this location and that it's outdoor rated (so
that the cable does not degrade and become brittle with long term exposure to sunlight).
You will need something to screw the weather station cases into. A square gate post or similar is
ideal. But this will be entirely up to you. There should be packet of eight 4 cm self tapping screws
that are included in the kit for this (they may be wrapped in brown parcel tape).
The case has four mounting holes in each corner. You may wish to pre-drill these so that it's easier
to get the self tapping screws though them. If you do this use no larger than a 3.5 mm drill bit.
A power drill or a hand drill, shown above, are both ideal to make the holes.
Rubber washers are provided to seal the holes for the self tapping screws used in the large case.
Take a washer and thread the screw through it as shown below.
All four mounting screws used in the large case should have these rubber washers to prevent any
ingress of water over time. The small case does not need them.
Ensure that you screw these down tightly so that the rubber washers are squeezed by the screw
head and thus creating a nice watertight seal.
Feel free to pre-drill the mounting holes in the AIR board case too. If you do this use no larger than
a 3.5 mm drill bit. These screws do not require the rubber washers because of the SSC3 conformal
coating protecting the AIR board.
The last thing the main case needs is the silica gel packet shown above, this is a desiccant material
and will absorb any moisture in the case after you close the lid. It will also mitigate any slight leaks
that may develop over time. You can probably get away without it but it's there as an extra
precaution.
Use all four screws, for both cases, when you're mounting them to a post or wall and ensure they're
close enough together so that the AIR cable can reach. The case must also be mounted low enough
to the ground to allow the tip of the ground temperature probe to reach 4 inches into the soil. If
you can’t manage this you could just use a flower pot!
The small packets of 4 screws included with each case, shown above, are used the screw the lids
shut. Ensure these are nice and tight when you finally close the lids.
The bases of the wind vane, anemometer and rain gauge have holes through which a screw can be
put. A proper mounting pole has not been provided but you each easily make one yourself very
cheaply.
Note: In the classroom it can be helpful to mount these on a table using some blue tack or plasticine.
Please email any feedback and suggestions to dave@raspberrypi.org at the Raspberry Pi Foundation.
Good luck!
