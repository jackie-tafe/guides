In order to use these tools at the same time as minecraft you need to set up you screen and be able to switch between them easily.

The key points mentioned in the video are:
- Arrange your minecraft and programming windows side by side to allow easy switching between them. (don't use minecraft in fullscreen mode.
- Open a minecraft world before trying to run your program.
- Use either the `esc` key or the `tab` key to release the cursor from game.
- Click back on the game window to regain control of the player.
