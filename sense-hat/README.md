![](cover.png)

The Sense HAT is an add-on board for the Raspberry Pi which allows you to sense a range of inputs and do creative things with them, including displaying information using the LED matrix. This activity will help you start using the sensors and LEDs in your projects.

## Requirements

Before following this resource it is a good idea to review the [Sense HAT Guide for Astro Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/learning/astro-pi-guide/), which will help you get your hardware set up and configured.
