# General Purpose Input Output Pins on a Raspberry Pi

One powerful feature of the Raspberry Pi is the row of GPIO (general purpose input/output) pins along the top edge of the board. These pins are a physical interface between the Pi and the outside world. At the simplest level, you can think of them as switches that you can turn on or off (input) or that the Pi can turn on or off (output).
