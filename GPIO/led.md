# What is an LED?

Why does the LED shine? When the circuit is plugged into the Raspberry Pi GPIO pins, electricity flows through the circuit. The flow is called the current. The LED lights up only when electric current flows from the long leg through the bulb to the short leg. The resistor reduces the amount of electric current passing through the circuit. This protects the LED from breaking, as a high current will make the light shine more brightly and then stop working.
